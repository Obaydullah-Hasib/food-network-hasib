    <h1>About Pizza</h1>
    <p >Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil,
    oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial
    setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.</p>
