            <h1>About Pizza</h1>
            <p>Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination
                of olive oil,
                oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually,
                in a commercial
                setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.</p>
